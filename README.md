# dlpve - quick proxmox install script

This is basically Proxmox’s docs, but wrapped in an install script designed for quick deployment. You want something fast? Like uhhhhhh? iPXE but for Proxmox? This is it.

The script sets hostname, picks the fastest mirror, nukes cloud-init and Debian kernels, sets up a NAT bridge, installs Proxmox VE, DHCP server, and configures port forwarding for easy web UI access.

Run it on a fresh Debian install and get your Proxmox VE up and running.
